so in the convertme.py file, there is the encrypted version of the flag.
by reading the code we can also see that the flag was encrypted using an XOR pad with the key 'enkidu'

so you can create a copy of the python script and modify it so the xor is done on the encrypted flag
without asking you about base convertion

but, of course, the challenge is in converting decimal to binary so I still did it that way

$ python3 convertme.py
If 23 is in decimal base, what is it in binary base?
Answer: 10111
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{4ll_y0ur_b4535_8730f5cd}
