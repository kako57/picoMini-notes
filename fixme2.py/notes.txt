By reading hint 1, we're looking for a typo in equality/assignment

The typo is at the if statement

if flag = "":
  print('String XOR encountered a problem, quitting.')
else:
  print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)

"=" is not an equality symbol in Python; it's for assignment
"==" is for equality, so we fix that then run the file

$ python3 fixed.py
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{3qu4l1ty_n0t_4551gnm3nt_b4d595d9}
