Here we go again
Same problem with PW Crack 1: the password is still exposed.

But this time the password is obfuscated.

$ python3 -c "print(chr(0x35) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x30) + chr(0x39))"
5909
$ python3 -c "print(chr(0x35) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x30) + chr(0x39))" | python3 level2.py
Please enter correct password for flag: Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{tr45h_51ng1ng_b0539d96}

Even though the bytes are readable, I still used pipes just to make sure.
