This time, we are given a dictionary to use.
The dictionary just lists all possible passwords.

I guess this challenge is to make sure that the person cracking the password
actually knows how to write a script for a dictionary attack using a wordlist

$ python3 solve.py
picoCTF{h45h_sl1ng1ng_36e992a6}

I wrote a script that can actually make use of multithreading,
but I guess the challenge is too simple; the script finished in less than a second
even with only one thread. It's still way quicker than actually doing it by hand.
